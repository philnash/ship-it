Installing an open-source Safari extension is a bit of a pain, because it has
to be signed by a dev certificate.

If you don't have a certificate for developing Safari extensions, go to
https://developer.apple.com/programs/start/safari/create.php and go create a
certificate and go through the whole process.

Once you have a certificate, you can open Extension Builder in Safari and
click the "+" button in the lower left to "Add Extensionâ€¦" and import this
extension so you can work on it and build it yourself.

If you just want to install it & run it, though, there's a pre-compiled
ship-it.extension file checked in to this directory.
